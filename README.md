# MAX-log-MAP Turbo Decoding in Python

**Status:** Under update, version 1.0

This is a coding exercise I completed for a course at Sun Yat-Sen University, "Information Theory and Coding."

This work attempts to present the decoding of the Turbo Code in different ways, 
and includes a Python implementation of encoding and decoding using Max-log-MAP method of BCJR, which is a kind of 
soft in and out algorithm.

Code now works on Python 3.6 and even higher versions.

**Addition:** More details about this code is
in the program file. And the puncturing pattern is [[1,1],[1,1]]
